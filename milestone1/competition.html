    <h2>Competition</h2>

    <p>My main competition includes other student portfolio websites, GitHub profiles, and online coding portfolios such as personal developer websites.</p>

    <h4>What competitors do well</h4>
    <p>Many portfolio websites look professional, have organized project sections, and use modern layouts with screenshots and links to code.</p>

    <h4>What competitors do poorly</h4>
    <p>A lot of student portfolios are boring, poorly organized, or don’t explain what the projects actually do. Some only list skills without showing proof.</p>

    <h4>How I will do it better</h4>
    <p>My site will clearly explain each project, show screenshots, and link directly to working code. I will also keep the design simple and easy to navigate so visitors can quickly see my best work.</p>
